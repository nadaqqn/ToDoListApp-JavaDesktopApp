This is a To-Do List Java Desktop application that features three main pages: Register, Login, and Dashboard. The Register page allows users to create an account, with their information being stored in a user database hosted on XAMPP. The Login page enables users to access the app by logging into their registered accounts stored in the database. Upon successful login, users are directed to the Dashboard, which contains three tabs: About, Task Management, and Feedback. The About tab provides a brief description of the application for users. The Task Management tab is the core of the To-Do List app, where users can add tasks by filling in details such as task name, date, timestamp, description, and categories (important, medium, normal). The entered information is displayed in a task list table, and users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their task list.
